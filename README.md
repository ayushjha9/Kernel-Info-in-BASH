# Kernel-Info-in-BASH
Gives you the processes, Thread, CPU usage, Memory regions and other information as a text file in a new folder!

Instructions:
1)    Set the correct user privileges by going to the directory where the .command file is saved, and then by entering the 
following command as per the need:

chmod u+x ~/<DIRECTORY>/kernelInfo.command

where <DIRECTORY> refers to the directory in which the command file has been saved by you.
  
2)    run the kernelInfo.command file by either double-clicking on it from your file system, or by running it through terminal
3)    feel free to press Control + C in order to stop the process once you're satisfied
4)    Great! Now you'll be able to read all the necessary information in a nice .txt file in the "kernelInfo" directory within      the <DIRECTORY>! Double-click it to read it in TextEdit or your favorite text editor!

Thank you.
